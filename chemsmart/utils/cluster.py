"""
Cluster utilities for job monitoring and connectivity checks.

Helpers for interacting with common HPC schedulers and network services
used by ChemSmart workflows. Currently supports SLURM (via `squeue`/`sacct`)
and PBS/Torque (via `qstat`) to discover running Gaussian jobs, along with a
simple PubChem reachability check.

Key functionality:
- Detect current username reliably.
- Query running Gaussian jobs (IDs and names) on SLURM or PBS/Torque.
- Validate network connectivity to PubChem for external lookups.
