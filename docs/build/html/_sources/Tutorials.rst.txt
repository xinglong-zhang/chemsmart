Welcome to the tutorials! We’re thrilled to have you here. Please go through the code examples, and don’t hesitate to contact our team if you have questions or feedback.

How to Use Chemsmart on Cluster
-------------------------------

As a powerful toolkit, chemsmart can work on any High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, using same commands as on the local machine to accomplish the same tasks. Please configure Chemsmart on your cluster according to the following steps.

Installation and Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*   Before starting the installation, please consult the HPC cluster administrator to confirm the pre-installed software on cluster, the support for required software, and your installation permissions in the specified directory.

*   Since most clusters are based on the Linux system, you can refer to **Installation - Installation for Linux and MacOS** to complete the installation and configuration of chemsmart on your cluster.

Set up the Project Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How to Run Gaussian Jobs
-------------------------------

With setup completed, one is able to run different Gaussian jobs via command-line interface (CLI).

*   To submit (and run) a geometry optimization job, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> opt

    where ``<server_name>`` is the one of the servers specified in ``~/.chemsmart/server/*.yaml`` files, without ``.yaml`` extension; ``<project>`` is one of the project settings specified in ``~/.chemsmart/gaussian/*.yaml`` files, without ``.yaml`` extension; and ``<input_file>`` is an input file the user wishes to run job on. Note that this input file can be any format, such as ``.xyz``, Gaussian ``.com``, ``.gjf`` or ``.log`` file or ORCA ``.inp`` or ``.out`` file.

*   If one wants to submit geometry optimization with frozen atoms in the molecule (such as https://www.researchgate.net/post/Freezing-atoms-in-gaussian-how-to-do-it), one can do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> opt -f <indices_of_atoms_to_freeze>

    or example, to submit the geometry optimization job with atoms numbered 1 to 10 frozen, one can do

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f input.com opt -f 1-10

.. note::

    1-indexed numbers are used, instead of 0-indexed numbers in Python language, since most visualization softwares for moleculare are 1-indexed.

*   To submit transition state modredundant job (frozen coordinates optimization), do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> modred -c <list_of_coords_to_constraint>

    For example, to submit a modredundant job with constraints on bond between atom 4 and atom 17 and on bond between atom 9 and atom 10, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f input.com modred -c [[4,17],[9,10]]

*   To submit transition state search job, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> ts

*   To submit intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) job, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> irc

*   To submit relaxed potential energy surface (PES) scan, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> scan -c <list_of_coords_to_constraint> -s <scan_step_size> -n <num_scan_steps>

*   For example, to submit the PES scan job with along bond between atom 4 and atom 17 for 10 steps with 0.1Å increment per step:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f input.com scan -c [[4,17]] -s 0.1 -n 10

*   To submit single point job, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> sp

    For single-point job that user wants to test which uses different solvent model and id from that specified in ``<project>``, one can do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> sp -sm <user_solvent_model> -si <user_solvent_id>

    to specify a different solvent model ``<user_solvent_model>`` and solvent ``<user_solvent_id>``.

*   To submit non-covalent interaction job, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> nci

*   To submit RESP charges fitting job, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> resp

.. note::

    This creates an input file with fix route for RESP job:
    ``HF/6-31+G(d) SCF=Tight Pop=MK IOp(6/33=2,6/41=10,6/42=17,6/50=1)``

*   To run opt or modred or ts conformers from crest run output, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> -c <system_charge> -m <system_multiplicity> crest -j opt

    or

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> -c <system_charge> -m <system_multiplicity> crest -j modred -c [1,4]

    or

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> -c <system_charge> -m <system_multiplicity> crest -j ts

    respectively

.. note::

    This optimizes all the conformers available in the ``<input_file>``. Typically, the ``<input_file>`` is a list of all conformers obtained by CREST program and named ``crest_conformers.xyz``.

*   To optimize a fixed number of lowest energy conformers, ``n_conformers_to_opt``, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> -c <system_charge> -m <system_multiplicity> crest -j opt -n <n_conformers_to_opt>

.. note::

    If the job terminates before ``<n_conformers_to_opt>`` are all optimized, perhaps due to walltime limit, resubmitting the job will continue crest opt job until all ``<n_conformers_to_opt>`` are optimized. Charge and multiplicity need to be specified, as these cannot be obtained from the supplied .xyz file. In fact, whenever .xyz file is used as input, the charge and multiplicity should be specified via ``-c <charge> -m <multiplicity`` via CLI.

*   To optimize unique structure from an md trajectory file, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> -c <system_charge> -m <system_multiplicity> saopt

.. note::

    This optimizes all the unique structures available in the md trajectory ``<input_file>``. Typically, the ``<input_file>`` is a list of all structures on an md trajectory obtained by ASE md run and named ``md.traj``. **(TODO: this method is not properly implemented in chemsmart yet.)**

*   To optimize a fixed number of lowest energy structures, ``<num_structures_to_opt>``, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <input_file> -c <system_charge> -m <system_multiplicity> saopt -n <n_conformers_to_opt>


    If the job terminates before ``<n_conformers_to_opt>`` are all optimized, perhaps due to walltime limit, resubmitting the job will continue crest opt job until all ``<n_conformers_to_opt>`` are optimized. Charge and multiplicity need to be specified, as these cannot be obtained from the supplied .traj file.

    Two grouper types for determining/clustering unique structures are available from CLI option ``-g``:

    1. Sequential grouper (default), selected by option value of seq, which sequentially checks for unique structures in a given list of md structures, and

    2. Self-consistent grouper, selected by option value of sc, which self-consistently checks for unique structures in a given list of md structures using the reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm for structure clustering. By default, only the last 0.1 proportion of the structures of the md.traj file is considered. This can be changed via cli option ``-x <proportion_structures_to_use>``.

    For example, to consider the last 20% of the structures in md.traj trajectory file, then uses Sequential grouper to group those structures into unique structures and run the 10 lowest energy structures from the list of unique structures found by the grouper:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f imd.traj saopt -x 0.2 -n 10 -g seq

*   To run distortion-interaction/activation-strain (DI-AS) job, do:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <project> -f <irc_output_file_for_dias> dias -i <indices_of_any_one_fragment> -n <number_of_every_n_step_along_irc_to_run>

    For example to run DI-AS job for fragment 1 with atoms numbered from 5-17 at every 10 steps along the irc.log file:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f irc.log dias -i 5-17 -n 10

*   If a user wants to run a job with pre-prepared Gaussian input file directly, one can run the job directly using:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <any_project_settings> -f <input_file> com

*   Generally, if a user wants to run job that is currently not present in our package, one can run custom job using:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s <server_name> gaussian -p <any_project_settings> -f <input_file> userjob -r <user_defined_gaussian_route> -a <appending_information_as_string_at_the_end_of_input_file_after_coordinates_specification>

*   For example, to create an input file named ``user_defined_job.com`` with user-specified route ``mnr functional/basis solvent`` etc and ``B 1 2 F\nA 1 2 3 F`` at the end of the input file after the specification of coordinates, run

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -l user_defined_job userjob -r 'mnr functional/basis solvent etc' -a 'B 1 2 F\nA 1 2 3 F'

To run ORCA jobs
-------------------------------
*   Similar commands exists for ORCA job submssions. One can run

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub orca --help

    to find out more.

General options available to all jobs
-------------------------------

*   Users can specify the name of the file to be created for the job, without file extension, they want to run by using the option ``-l``, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -l custom_job_name opt

    will create input file named ``custom_job_name.com`` instead of the default ``test_opt.com``.

*   Users can also simply append a string to the base name of the filename supplied, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -a append_string ts

    will create input file named ``test_append_string.com`` instead of the default ``test_ts.com``.

*   Users can also modify the charge and multiplicity from the CLI, e.g.:

    Modify the charge in ``test.com`` to charge of +1 in the newly created input file ``test_charge.com`` via:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -c 1 -a charge opt

    Modify the multiplicity in ``test.com`` to multiplicity of 3 in the newly created input file ``test_multiplicity.com`` via:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -m 3 -a multiplicity opt

    Modify the charge to +1 and multiplicity to 2 in the newly created input ``file test_charge_multiplicity.com`` via:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -c 1 -m 2 -l test_charge_multiplicity opt

.. tip::

    This can be useful when, e.g., using optimized structure of a neutral closed-shell (charge 0, multiplicity 1) system to run a charged radical ion (e.g., charge +1 and multiplicity 2 in radical cation).

*   Users can also modify the functional and basis from the CLI to differ from those in project settings, e.g.:

    Modify the functional to ``b3lyp`` in the newly created input file ``test_functional.com`` via:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -x b3lyp -a functional opt

    Modify the basis to ``6-31G*`` in the newly created input file ``test_basis.com`` via:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -b "6-31G*" -a basis opt

*   Users can also specify additional optimization options for opt=() in the route, for example,

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com -o maxstep=8,maxsize=12 -a opt_options opt

    will create ``opt=(maxstep=8,maxsize=12)`` as part of the route in the newly created input file ``test_opt_options.com``.

*   Users can also add in additional parameters used in the route, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f test.com --r nosymm -a route_params opt

    will add in ``nosymm`` as part of the route in the newly created input file ``test_route_params.com``.

*   If one has more than one structure in the supplied file for input preparation, one can select the particular structure to perform job on by using the ``-i/--index`` option, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: console

        chemsmart sub -s shared gaussian -p test -f small.db -i 5 -c 0 -m 1 opt

    will take the 5th structure (1-indexed, as in chemsmart) from ase database file, ``small.db``, to create the input file for geometry optimization.
