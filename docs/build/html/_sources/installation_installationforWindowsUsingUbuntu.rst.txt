Installation for Windows Using Ubuntu
-------------------------------------

Alternatively, Windows users may install chemsmart via Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

*   Ubuntu can be accessed and downloaded from https://ubuntu.com, and is also available directly on the Microsoft Store.

*   Once Ubuntu is installed, one can proceed to install either Anaconda3 or Miniconda3 *for Linux* via https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html.

*   Next, the ``git`` and ``make`` can be installed in Ubuntu via:

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo apt install git

    and

    .. code-block:: console

        sudo apt install make

As Ubuntu is fundamentally based on the Linux kernel, one can follow the instructions in **Installation - Installation for Linux and macOS** to complete the following setup of chemsmart.
