Set up the Server Configuration on the Cluster
----------------------------------------------

Once the user has completed the installation, the server configuration on the cluster can be customized by modifying corresponding files.

.. note::
    A user can modify the contents in ``~/.chemsmart`` files freely without affecting or needing to know the ``chemsmart`` source code.

*   The ``~/.chemsmart/usersettings.yaml`` file contains informations such as project number or account number that are required in a typical submission script that specifies the account for use at some HPC servers. It can also contain options specifying user's email to inform user of the job start and job end once a job is submitted. If more features are needed, please submit a request via `Issues`. A typical ``~/.chemsmart/usersettings.yaml`` file looks like this:

        .. code-block:: console

            PROJECT: 1234567  # alias ACCOUNT FOR SLURM
            EMAIL: abc@gmail.com

*   The ``~/.chemsmart/server/`` directory contains files related to server setup for a particular HPC cluster that the user is using. For example, we can specify a SLURM based server setting as ``~/.chemsmart/server/shared.yaml`` with the following information:

        .. code-block:: console

            SERVER:
                SCHEDULER: SLURM

    This file can be customized by user for different submission systems. This file contains the server configuration information that is needed for chemsmart to automatically write the submission script for each job.
