##############################
 Installation for HPC Cluster
##############################

As a powerful toolkit, chemsmart can work on any High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, using same commands as on the
local machine to accomplish the same tasks. If you only need to use chemsmart on a HPC cluster, you can install
chemsmart solely on the cluster.

-  Before starting the installation, please consult the HPC cluster administrator to confirm the pre-installed software
   on cluster, the support for required software, and your installation permissions in the specified directory.
-  Since most clusters are based on the Linux system, one can refer to **Installation - Installation for Linux and
   MacOS** to complete the installation and configuration of chemsmart on your cluster.
