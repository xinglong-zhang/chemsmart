 Thermochemistry Analysis Jobs
*******************************

In CHEMSMART, the ``thermochemistry`` command currently supports parsing output files from **Gaussian** and **ORCA**,
enabling users to recalculate and apply corrections to thermochemical properties such as enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs
free energy based on quantum chemical results.

USAGE
=====

.. code:: console

   chemsmart run thermochemistry [-d path/to/directory] [-t log|out] [-f filename(s)]
                                 [-csg s_freq_cutoff] [-cst s_freq_cutoff]
                                 [-ch h_freq_cutoff] [-c concentration] [-p pressure] [-w]

THERMO_OPTIONS
==============

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 75

   -  -  Option
      -  Type
      -  Description

   -  -  ``-d, --directory``
      -  string
      -  |  Specifies a directory containing files to be processed in batch.
         |  This option is mutually exclusive with ``-f``.

   -  -  ``-t, --filetype``
      -  string
      -  |  Specifies the file type in the directory, either ``log`` (Gaussian) or ``out`` (ORCA).
         |  This option is only used together with ``-d``.

   -  -  ``-f, --filenames``

      -  string

      -  |  Specifies one or more individual files to analyze.
         |  This option can be used multiple times and is mutually exclusive with ``-d``
         |  and ``-t``.

   -  -  ``-csg, --cutoff-entropy-grimme``

      -  float

      -  |  Specifies the cut-off frequency (in wavenumbers) for applying Grimme’s
         |  quasi-rigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator (quasi-RRHO) correction to entropy.
         |  For example, ``-csg 100`` applies cut-off frequency of 100 :math:`\rm cm^{-1}` to entropy
         |  when computing corrected entropy (*qh-S*).

   -  -  ``-cst, --cutoff-entropy-truhlar``

      -  float

      -  |  Specifies the cut-off frequency (in wavenumbers) for applying Truhlar’s
         |  quasi-RRHO approach to entropy.
         |  Vibrational modes with frequencies below the cut-off are raised to the
         |  cut-off value instead of being treated by the standard RRHO approximation.

.. note::

   The ``-csg`` and ``-cst`` options are mutually exclusive, and only one of them can be specified at most. If neither
   is specified, the quasi-RRHO entropy correction is not applied and only the standard entropy (*S*) is calculated.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :widths: 15 10 75

   -  -  ``-ch, --cutoff-enthalpy``

      -  float

      -  |  Specifies the cut-off frequency (in wavenumbers) for applying
         |  Head-Gordon’s quasi-RRHO correction to enthalpy.
         |  For example, ``-ch 50`` applies a cut-off frequency of 50 :math:`\rm cm^{-1}` to enthalpy
         |  when calculating corrected enthalpy (*qh-H*).
         |  If not specified, no quasi-RRHO correction is applied to enthalpy and only
         |  the standard enthalpy (*H*) is calculated.

   -  -  ``-c, --concentration``

      -  float

      -  |  Specifies the solution concentration (in mol/L).
         |  In this case, the translational partition function is evaluated in the
         |  concentration-dependent form, instead of the pressure-dependent form
         |  used in the gas phase.
         |  This correction follows directly from the Sackur-Tetrode equation of
         |  translational entropy.
         |  If ``-c`` is not specified, the calculation defaults to the gas phase.

   -  -  ``-p, --pressure``
      -  float
      -  |  Specifies the gas-phase pressure (in atm), with a default value of 1.0 atm.

.. note::

   The ``-c`` and ``-p`` options are mutually exclusive. If both are provided, ``-c`` takes precedence and ``-p`` is
   ignored.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0
   :widths: 15 10 75

   -  -  ``-w, --weighted``
      -  bool
      -  |  Uses masses weighted by natural isotopic abundance.
         |  By default, the most abundant isotope masses are used.

   -  -  ``-T, --temperature``
      -  float
      -  |  **Required**. Specifies the temperature (in Kelvin).

   -  -  ``-a, --alpha``
      -  int
      -  |  Specifies the interpolator exponent (alpha) in the quasi-RRHO scheme.
         |  The default value is 4.

   -  -  ``-u, --energy-units``

      -  string

      -  |  Specifies the units for energetic values.
         |  Options include ``hartree``, ``eV``, ``kcal/mol``, and ``kJ/mol``.
         |  The default unit is ``hartree``.

   -  -  ``-o, --outputfile``
      -  string
      -  |  Specifies the output file to save the thermochemistry results.
         |  By default, results are saved to a file named ``file_basename.dat``.

   -  -  ``-O, --overwrite``
      -  bool
      -  |  Overwrites existing output files if they already exist.
         |  By default, the results are appended to the existing file.

   -  -  ``-i, --check-imaginary-frequencies``
      -  bool
      -  |  Checks for imaginary frequencies in the calculations.
         |  By default, this check is performed.

   -  -  ``-S, --skip-completed / -R, --no-skip-completed``

      -  bool

      -  |  Controls how completed jobs are handled.
         |  ``-R`` forces rerun completed Thermochemistry jobs, ``-S`` skips completed jobs.
         |  By default, ``-S`` is enabled.
