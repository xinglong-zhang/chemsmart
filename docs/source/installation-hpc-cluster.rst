 Installation for HPC Cluster
##############################

Chemsmart can run on any High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, using
the same commands as on a local machine. If you only need to use
Chemsmart on an HPC cluster, you can install it directly there.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

Before starting:

-  Consult your HPC cluster administrator about pre-installed software
   and your installation permissions.
-  Confirm the supported queue system (SLURM, Torque, PBS, etc.).

 Installation

Since most HPC clusters run Linux, follow the instructions in
:doc:`installation-linux-macos` to install Chemsmart on your cluster.
