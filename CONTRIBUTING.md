**You need PYTHON 3.10!**

This instructions are for linux base systems. (Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.)
## Setting up your own fork of this repo.

- On github interface click on `Fork` button.
- Clone your fork of this repo. `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GIT_USERNAME/chemsmart.git`
- Enter the directory `cd chemsmart`
- Add upstream repo `git remote add upstream https://github.com/xinglong-zhang/chemsmart`

## Setting up your own conda environment

Follow the Installation Guide on README. Briefly, run
```bash
make env
```
to create a conda environment.

## Install the project in develop mode

Then run
```bash
make install
```
to install the project in develop mode.

## Run the tests to ensure everything is working

Run
```bash
make test
```
to run the tests.

## Create a new branch to work on your contribution

Run
```bash
git checkout -b my_contribution_branch
```

## Make your changes

Edit the files using your preferred editor (we recommend PyCharm IDE).

## Add in additional python packages that are imported in your new codes

Run
```bash
make update-deps
```

## Format the code

Run
```bash
make fmt
```
to format the code. We use `isort` to sort the import statements alphabetically and `black` formatter.

## Run the linter

Run
```bash
make lint
```
to run the linter. We use `ruff` as linter to check for potential bugs, syntax errors, and stylistic issues.

## Test your changes

Please include relevant tests for the new functionalities that you are introducing. Then, run
```bash
make test
```
to run these tests and make sure that they pass.

Ensure code coverage report shows `100%` coverage, add tests to your PR.

## Build the docs locally (optional)

Run
```bash
make docs
```
to build the docs.

Ensure your new changes are documented.

## Commit your changes

This project uses [conventional git commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Example: `fix(package): update setup.py arguments üéâ` (emojis are fine too)

## Push your changes to your fork

## Making a new release (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and tags releases with `X.Y.Z`
Every time a new tag is created and pushed to the remote repo, github actions will
automatically create a new release on github and trigger a release on PyPI.

For this to work you need to setup a secret called `PIPY_API_TOKEN` on the project settings>secrets,
this token can be generated on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/account/).

To trigger a new release all you need to do is:

1. If you have changes to add to the repo
    * Make your changes following the steps described above.
    * Commit your changes following the [conventional git commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
2. Run the tests to ensure everything is working.
4. Run `make release` to create a new tag and push it to the remote repo.

the `make release` will ask you the version number to create the tag, ex: type `0.1.1` when you are asked.

> **CAUTION**:  The make release will change local changelog files and commit all the unstaged changes you have.
